expressjs-template
==================

My expressjs project template for building RESTful APIs.

## Installation

    npm install
    sudo npm install grunt -g
    sudo npm install mocha -g
  
## Start a server  
    grunt
  
## Test
    grunt test
  
## Jshint

I didn't put jshint in the Gruntfile, since I think it's enough to use jshint in Emacs while editing code.
